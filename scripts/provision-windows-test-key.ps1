.SYNOPSIS
    Provisions the KEK the native integration tests use on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs the installed HkdfGuard tool's "provision" command for the test service name, which creates
    a machine-wide KEK for it in the Platform Crypto Provider (TPM), or re-verifies it if it already
    exists. Safe to run repeatedly. It never wraps a DEK and never touches a key file.

    Must run from an elevated PowerShell: creating a machine-wide KEK requires administrator rights.

    Before running the tool, the script checks that it is the signed HkdfGuard tool from the fixed
    install location - the same publisher, pinned root and Artifact Signing profile the library's
    own loader requires - so an elevated session never runs an impostor.

    Once provisioned, the native tests in HkdfGuard.KeyWrapping.V1.Test run automatically on this
    machine instead of being reported as skipped:

        dotnet test test/HkdfGuard.KeyWrapping.V1.Test

.PARAMETER ServiceName
    The service whose KEK to provision. Defaults to the name the tests use.
