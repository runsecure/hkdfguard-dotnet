# Provisions the TPM-backed KEKs the native integration tests use on Linux.
#
# The libhkdfguard1 package installs no policy and no TPM derivation secret, so on a fresh host
# every wrap fails with "no KEK is provisioned" (-9). This script, run once with sudo from the
# account that runs the tests:
#
#   1. checks the installed hkdfguard packages against dpkg's checksums, and that the test
#      account can open the TPM (it must be in the tss group);
#   2. creates /etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret (32 random bytes, root:<test user's group>,
#      0440) if there isn't one - an existing secret is never replaced, because that would change
#      every TPM KEK on this host;
#   3. writes /etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml requiring the TPM, the derivation secret, and a pinned
#      TPM Name for each test service (the provisioning allowlist), learning each Name from the
#      TPM itself through hkdfguard-v1-initialize, run as the test user;
#   4. runs "hkdfguard-v1-initialize provision" for both services, as the test user, to confirm.
#
# It refuses to overwrite a policy it didn't write. Re-running it is safe: it re-learns the same
# Names (the KEKs are derived on demand from the TPM's seed and the secret) and rewrites its own
# policy. It never wraps a DEK and never touches a key file.
#
# Then run the native tests:
#
#   HKDFGUARD_TEST_SERVICE=com.hkdfguard.native.linux.test \
#   HKDFGUARD_TEST_SERVICE_OTHER=com.hkdfguard.native.linux.test.other \
#   dotnet test test/HkdfGuard.KeyWrapping.V1.Test
#
# Usage:
#   sudo scripts/provision-linux-test-key.sh            # provision
#   sudo scripts/provision-linux-test-key.sh --remove   # remove the policy this script wrote
#
# --remove leaves the derivation secret in place and says how to delete it: deleting it makes
# every DEK wrapped on this host's TPM unrecoverable.
